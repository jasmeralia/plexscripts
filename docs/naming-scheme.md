# Naming Scheme

## Videos

The videos that I am storing come from six major categories of sources, each of which have their own different naming schemes:

### Gamelink / Adult Empire

* `Scene 8 From Dinner Party The - 1080p.mp4`
* `Scene 1 From Gothsend 4 - 480p.mp4`

(Some videos are a single scene video, in which case the `Scene X From` part is discarded.)

### Ultrafilms/Wow Girls

* `Anjelica_SunnySkin_4096x2160_60fps.mp4`
* `Anjelica_GinaGerson_BreakfastByThePool_1920x1080_30fps.mp4`

### angels.love / sensual.love

`captivating-approach_mencia-francis_naomi-hill_3840x2160.mp4`

### ManyVids

Most videos tend to follow the format of `CreatorName-Video-Title.mp4`, although this is not always the case.

### Vixen Media Group

The filenames here are very obscure to the point of uselessness as far as I am concerned, like:

* `TUSHY_101326_2160P.mp4`
* `SLAYED_103378_2160P.mp4`

### Other sources

For other sources, the naming scheme varies quite a bit, usually based on the tool used to perform the downloads. Some of them allow you to customize the filename format, others do not.

### My Scheme

* `Anjelica - Sunny Skin.mp4` (formerly from Ultrafilms/Wow Girls)
* `Anjelica, Gina Gerson - Breakfast By The Pool.mp4` (formerly from Ultrafilms/Wow Girls)
* `Mencia Francis, Naomi Hill - Captivating Approach.mp4` (formerly from angels.love/sensual.love)
* `Asia Carrera - The Dinner Party (Scene #8).mp4` (formerly from Gamelink/Adult Empire)
* `Joanna Angel - Gothsend #4 (Scene #1).mp4` (formerly from Gamelink/Adult Empire)
* `Kenzie Reeves, Vina Sky - Commission.mp4` (formerly from Tushy)
* `Azul Hermosa, Aria Taylor - Bad Date` (formerly from Slayed)

Basically, it will always have a comma separated list of the non-male stars, followed by the title of the video, separated by a dash surrounded by spaces. If it is a scene from a larger VOD, the Scene number is appended in parentheses. Any `Vol <X>`, `V<X>`, or number at the end of the title is prefixed with a `#` for consistency. (Where possible, if I know that something is the first in a series of videos, I will also manually apppend `#1` to it as well.)

## Collections

I have a few categories of collection tags, each prefixed with numbers.

# 000: and 00:

These are mostly key smart collections that I want to be able to access quickly, although there are a couple of static collections such as `000: FAVORITES` and `000: TOP FAVORITES`.

# 01: Category:

These are all static collections that apply to the videos, like:

* `01: Category: FFF+`
* `01: Category: Red Hair`
* `01: Category: Solo`

I may refine these further, such as:

* `01: Category: Hair: Red`
* `01: Category: Composition: Solo`
* `01: Category: Composition: FFF+`

But I haven't wanted to get that granular quite yet.

# 02: Studio

These are all smart collections based off of the Studio name, such as:

* `02: Studio: Digital Sin`
* `02: Studio: Ultrafilms`
* `02: Studio: Wow Girls`

There is one exception to this naming scheme, which is `02: Independent Content`, which is for videos from sites like ManyVids/MFC Share and such, where there is no actual production studio involved.

# 03: Star

These are all smart collections based off of the stars, which I store as writers (given that Plex does not allow you to directly edit the actors field).

* `03: Star: Anjelica`
* `03: Star: Gina Gerson`
